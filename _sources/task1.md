# Task 1: The Project Approval Form

## Choosing a Topic

The Capstone Project Approval Form should help you to clearly define your capstone project scope and to ensure the project will support the task requirements. Your final network project will be evaluated based on its ability to satisfy ten test case scenarios. There are seven predefined test case scenarios, with the remaining three test cases to be defined by you. 

A clearly defined scope is essential for your Capstone Instructor to accurately assess the validity of your proposed network project and the expected timeline for completion. Work with your instructor before submitting this form if you are unclear on the organizational need or what an appropriately sized network will include. Try to scale your network project to no more than that of a 10-user network. A network that is too small will not have all of the connections or devices that are required to validate each of the seven required test cases. A network that is too large will take unnecessary time and effort for you to build, test, and deploy.  

Your project will be built inside of a virtual lab environment using either GNS3 or Packet Tracer. It is recommended to explore the virtual lab environment selected and the included tools during the planning process to ensure alignment between the proposed network project and the available virtual networking tools.

Projects involving human subjects, or the use of protected data will require IRB approval. Work directly with your instructor if your project includes research that involves human subjects to determine whether it requires review by WGU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).

## Topic Approval

Once you’ve decided on a topic, complete the following Capstone Project Approval Form by identifying the organizational overview, network scope, and network diagram for your proposed network project. Additionally, review the seven predefined test case scenarios and define three custom test cases to be validated against your network project.
