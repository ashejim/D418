# Task 2: The Functionality Report

:::{note}
Task 1 (the capstone project and scope) must be approved by a Capstone Instructor prior to implementation in the virtual environment.
:::

During Task 2, you will complete a functionality report detailing the ten test case scenarios used to verify the utility of your network project. Seven of the test case scenarios will be from the provided predefined list, with the remaining three test cases created by you. The functionality report should be written so that a networking peer could replicate the steps for a successful test of your networking solution. 

You will also discuss how you analyzed the network to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve issues during development or when ensuring functionality of the test cases.
